KRAV 1:3 
Read the right file for the level of difficulty chosen:

I have implemented the 3 levels of difficulty for the test from the 3 files by mapping
the menu choice (1, 2, 3) to the respective text file in a dictionay called level_mapping 
in the main function and then sending level_mapping[choice] as an argument for the functions
used to read the right file according to choice.

The python code has the following flow:
It reads the file according to the level and then for each line:
- prints the line and gets the user input and how long it took in seconds (get_input_and_time function)
- uses some user defined functions to count the number of words and letters 
for both the text and input as well as storing the words that don't match with the input into a list of tuples
of form ('file word', 'input word') 



Uses another function for suming up these metrics for all the lines in the file which would give
all the needed metrics for calculation word precision and time
The next step is to get the same kind of metrics but for the letters. For this, the program
uses the same function that was used to get the unmatching words but with each of the unmatching words 
tuple as argument. This will give a list of unmatching letters which will then be used to count the mistakes and 
to list the leters that were entered wrong and occurences.
Once the program calculated all the raw metrics, it uses a function called get_test_results get all these 
raw metrics by calling the needed functions and further processing the results according to the specifications.
Then, another function is used for printing the results in the right format.
